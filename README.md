Copy-Move Forgery Database with Similar but Genuine Objects
=============

The Copy-Move Forgery Database with Similar but Genuine Objects (COVERAGE) accompanies the following publication: "COVERAGE– A NOVEL DATABASE FOR COPY-MOVE FORGERY DETECTION," IEEE International Conference on Image processing, 2016 [ICIP 2016] (http://2016.ieeeicip.org/)"

Dataset description:

COVERAGE contains copymove forged (CMFD) images and their originals with similar but genuine objects (SGOs). COVERAGE is designed to highlight and address tamper detection ambiguity of popular methods, caused by self-similarity within natural images. In COVERAGE, forged–original pairs are annotated with (i) the duplicated and forged region masks, and (ii) the tampering factor/similarity metric. For benchmarking, forgery quality is evaluated using (i) computer vision-based methods, and (ii) human detection performance.
